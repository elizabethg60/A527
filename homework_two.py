"""
Write a least-squares fitting code that implements the Levenberg-
Marquardt algorithm

"""
Use the above least-squares fitting code to fit the data hw2 fitting.dat
on CANVAS with two functions: a Lorentzian as in Equation (1), and a
Gaussian as in Equation (2)

"""
Plot the data and the fitting curves, be sure to include the
error-bars of the data. Which function fits the data better and why?
